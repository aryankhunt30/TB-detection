# Dataset
This model is developed with the help of dataset from Kaggle.
Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset) to go to the Kaggle Dataset. 

# Motivation
In this century where everything is at our fingertips, why wait in a long queue to get your X-rays scanned by a radiologist? Especially to find out if you or your loved ones are affected by a serious disease like Tuberculosis? Not anymore, weâ€™ve developed a system that brings radiologists to your fingertips!



# Installation

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```git init```

```git clone https://github.com/jith4j/Tuberculosis-Classification.git```


# Contribute

This project is made only to classify if an X-ray is having Tuberculosis or not. As a next step, the model could be further developed to classify if an X-ray image is having any other disease also.
